Welcome to my first css project I had with my journey I am having with the Odin Project! 

This was a really interesting project, and I really learned a lot by putting the things I learned on css into practice! I added in some features I learned about to make it more dynamic, and it was awesome to see that actually work. 

 It took me a while to figure out why I would be having conflicts on some sections, and I realized a few things. One, by drawing out on paper the html structure really helped for me to understand the overview and what relationships I needed. Then it was all a matter of looking closely at my nested containers and seeing which rules I was applying it to. 

 Overall, this was a fun experience making it!
